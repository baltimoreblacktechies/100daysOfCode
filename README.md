# **TEMPLATE TODO 🗒️🗒️🗒️**:
### (remove me)
This repository seeks to serve as a template for organizations/groups that would collectively like to participate in the 100 days of code project. To use this project, replace all words in `<tags>` with the respective value. For instance, `<year> -> 2022`. You should just be able to search for occurrences of `<`. Additionally, address wherever there is a TODO. For an example of this template in use, see [BBT-2021](https://github.com/baltimoreblacktechies/100daysOfCode-2021/) and for the auto-generated tracking site, [see the rendering of this template](https://baltimoreblacktechies.github.io/100daysOfCode).

You may also want to edit `mkdocs.yml` for static site generation. Contributions are counted in a given day, are will not be counted if the phrases `DNT`, `Updated README` or `Merge pull request` are present in a commit message.

### TODO: Add more relevant badges. Example badges below. Note that the contributor and days code are automatically generated and can be changed for your repo.
  
The challenge is to code at least **one hour every day for the next 100 days**.
This is just a repository for members of `<organization>` to share some of their projects, efforts and notes. Let's see if we can get 100 days of code together!

## FAQ:

### What Is The #100daysOfCode Challenge?

100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100daysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery. Plus, the hashtag fosters a sense of community—you can use it to see where others are at in their journey and to stay  motivated to document your own.

### How Can I Participate?

Do #100daysOfCode with `<organization>`! Work your way through projects, or document your Tech journey—either way, posting what you’re learning each day is a great way to see your coding progress unfold and find support. We’ll support you with encouraging messages along the way, and you’ll have the entire `<organization>` online community to supplement your interactions. At the end of your 100 days coding with us, you’ll get a host of experience and several friends that have taken part in this challenge.

## Two Main Rules

1.  Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2.  Slack your progress every day with the` <communication>` channel.

## Instructions

* Create a github account
* Fork our repo locally: https://github.com/`<link>`

Let's have fun and support everyone in their tech journey
